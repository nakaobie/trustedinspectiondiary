Perfect! Let’s create a **FAQPage JSON‑LD** block you can paste into your FAQ page (or any page with common questions). This will allow Google to show expandable answers directly in search results.

## 📑 Example FAQPage JSON‑LD
Add this inside the `<head>` of your **FAQ page**:

```html
<script type="application/ld+json">
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "FAQPage",
  "mainEntity": [
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "Do you attend rental inspections on my behalf?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Yes, we attend open homes and private inspections for clients in Hobart."
      }
    },
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "Can you help with student housing?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "We provide independent checks to ensure students get accurate information about housing options."
      }
    },
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "Do you offer relocation support?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Yes, we assist with settling into new homes and communities in Tasmania."
      }
    },
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "Do landlords use your services?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Yes, we conduct routine property inspections for landlords to ensure their properties are well maintained."
      }
    }
  ]
}
</script>
```

## ✅ How to Use
- Place this block in the `<head>` of your FAQ page.  
- Replace questions/answers with your actual FAQ content.  
- Keep answers concise (Google prefers short, clear text).  
- Validate with **Google’s Rich Results Test** to confirm it’s working.

👉 Do you want me to also show you how to **combine multiple schema types** (e.g., LocalBusiness + FAQPage) on the same page without conflicts, so you maximize SEO impact?
