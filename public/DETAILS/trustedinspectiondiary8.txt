Perfect! Let’s add a **BreadcrumbList schema** so Google can display a navigation path (like *Home > Services > Contact*) in search results. This improves SEO and helps users understand your site’s structure.

## 📑 Example BreadcrumbList JSON‑LD
Place this inside the `<head>` of each page, tailored to that page’s position in the hierarchy.

### On the **Services Page**
```html
<script type="application/ld+json">
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "BreadcrumbList",
  "itemListElement": [
    {
      "@type": "ListItem",
      "position": 1,
      "name": "Home",
      "item": "https://trustedinspectiondiary.com.au/"
    },
    {
      "@type": "ListItem",
      "position": 2,
      "name": "Services",
      "item": "https://trustedinspectiondiary.com.au/services.html"
    }
  ]
}
</script>
```

### On the **Contact Page**
```html
<script type="application/ld+json">
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "BreadcrumbList",
  "itemListElement": [
    {
      "@type": "ListItem",
      "position": 1,
      "name": "Home",
      "item": "https://trustedinspectiondiary.com.au/"
    },
    {
      "@type": "ListItem",
      "position": 2,
      "name": "Services",
      "item": "https://trustedinspectiondiary.com.au/services.html"
    },
    {
      "@type": "ListItem",
      "position": 3,
      "name": "Contact",
      "item": "https://trustedinspectiondiary.com.au/contact.html"
    }
  ]
}
</script>
```

## ✅ Best Practices
- Always reflect the **real navigation path** of your site.  
- Update URLs to match your actual file structure.  
- Keep positions sequential (`1, 2, 3…`).  
- Use consistent naming (e.g., “About Us” vs “About”).  
- Validate with **Google’s Rich Results Test**.

## ⚡ Why Breadcrumbs Help
- Improve **click‑through rates** by showing clear navigation in search results.  
- Help Google understand your site hierarchy.  
- Enhance user experience by reinforcing structure.

👉 Would you like me to also prepare a **combined schema example** (LocalBusiness + FAQPage + BreadcrumbList) for one page, so you can see how they all work together seamlessly?
