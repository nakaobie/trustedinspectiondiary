Perfect! Let’s put everything together into a **combined schema example** so you can see how **LocalBusiness + FAQPage + BreadcrumbList** work seamlessly on one page. This is especially useful for a **Contact page** where you want Google to show your business info, FAQs, and navigation path.

## 📑 Combined JSON‑LD Example (Contact Page)

```html
<!-- LocalBusiness schema -->
<script type="application/ld+json">
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "LocalBusiness",
  "name": "Trusted Inspection Diary",
  "url": "https://trustedinspectiondiary.com.au/contact.html",
  "telephone": "+61-400-123-456",
  "email": "info@trustedinspectiondiary.com.au",
  "address": {

    "addressCountry": "AU"
  },
  "openingHours": "Mo-Fr 09:00-17:00",
  "priceRange": "$$"
}
</script>

<!-- FAQPage schema -->
<script type="application/ld+json">
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "FAQPage",
  "mainEntity": [
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "Do you attend rental inspections on my behalf?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Yes, we attend open homes and private inspections for clients in Hobart."
      }
    },
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "Can you help with student housing?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "We provide independent checks to ensure students get accurate information about housing options."
      }
    },
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "Do you offer relocation support?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Yes, we assist with settling into new homes and communities in Tasmania."
      }
    }
  ]
}
</script>

<!-- BreadcrumbList schema -->
<script type="application/ld+json">
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "BreadcrumbList",
  "itemListElement": [
    {
      "@type": "ListItem",
      "position": 1,
      "name": "Home",
      "item": "https://trustedinspectiondiary.com.au/"
    },
    {
      "@type": "ListItem",
      "position": 2,
      "name": "Services",
      "item": "https://trustedinspectiondiary.com.au/services.html"
    },
    {
      "@type": "ListItem",
      "position": 3,
      "name": "Contact",
      "item": "https://trustedinspectiondiary.com.au/contact.html"
    }
  ]
}
</script>
```

## ✅ Why This Works
- **LocalBusiness** → Google can show your business details (address, phone, hours).  
- **FAQPage** → Google can display expandable Q&A directly in search results.  
- **BreadcrumbList** → Google shows a navigation path (Home > Services > Contact).  

Each block is **separate**, so they don’t conflict. Search engines parse them independently.

---

## ⚡ Pro Tip
- Tailor schema types per page (e.g., `AboutPage` for About, `Service` for Services).  
- Always validate with **Google’s Rich Results Test**.  
- Keep answers short and clear for FAQPage.

👉 Would you like me to also prepare a **Service schema bundle** for your Services page (covering multiple services like rental inspections, student housing, relocation), so Google can highlight each offering individually?
