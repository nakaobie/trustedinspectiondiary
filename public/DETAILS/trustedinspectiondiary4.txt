Great! Let’s add **structured data (JSON‑LD)** to your Vite multi‑page site so Google and other search engines can display rich snippets (like services, reviews, or contact info).

## 📌 What is JSON‑LD?
- JSON‑LD = *JavaScript Object Notation for Linked Data*.  
- It’s a `<script>` block inside your HTML `<head>` that describes your business in a way search engines understand.  
- Helps Google show rich results (like business info, breadcrumbs, FAQs, reviews).

## 🏠 Example: Local Business Structured Data
For a business like *Trusted Inspection Diary*, you’d add this to **each page’s `<head>`**:

```html
<script type="application/ld+json">
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "LocalBusiness",
  "name": "Trusted Inspection Diary",
  "image": "https://trustedinspectiondiary.com.au/assets/logo.png",
  "url": "https://trustedinspectiondiary.com.au/",
  "telephone": "+61-400-123-456",
  "address": {
    "@type": "PostalAddress",
    "streetAddress": "123 Example Street",
    "addressLocality": "Hobart",
    "addressRegion": "TAS",
    "postalCode": "7000",
    "addressCountry": "AU"
  },
  "openingHours": "Mo-Fr 09:00-17:00",
  "priceRange": "$$",
  "description": "Independent property inspections, rental viewings, and relocation support in Tasmania.",
  "sameAs": [
    "https://www.facebook.com/trustedinspectiondiary",
    "https://www.instagram.com/trustedinspectiondiary"
  ]
}
</script>
```

## 📑 Other Useful Schema Types
- **BreadcrumbList** → Helps Google show navigation paths.  
- **FAQPage** → Great for a FAQ section, shows expandable answers in search results.  
- **Service** → If you want to highlight specific services (e.g., “Student Housing Inspection”).  

Example for FAQ:
```html
<script type="application/ld+json">
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "FAQPage",
  "mainEntity": [
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "Do you attend rental inspections on my behalf?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Yes, we attend open homes and private inspections for clients in Hobart."
      }
    },
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "Can you help with student housing?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "We provide independent checks to ensure students get accurate information about housing options."
      }
    }
  ]
}
</script>
```

## ✅ Best Practices
- Place JSON‑LD inside `<head>` of each HTML file.  
- Tailor metadata per page (e.g., About page might use `AboutPage` schema).  
- Validate with **Google’s Rich Results Test** or **Schema.org validator**.

👉 Do you want me to create a **ready‑to‑use JSON‑LD bundle** for your site (Home, About, Services, Contact) so you can paste it directly into each page?
