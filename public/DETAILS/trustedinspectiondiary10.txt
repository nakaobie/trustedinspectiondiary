Perfect! Let’s prepare a **Service schema bundle** for your **Services page** so Google can highlight each offering individually (like rental inspections, student housing, relocation support).  

---

## 📑 Example JSON‑LD for Multiple Services
Paste this into the `<head>` of your **services.html**:

```html
<script type="application/ld+json">
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "WebPage",
  "name": "Services - Trusted Inspection Diary",
  "url": "https://trustedinspectiondiary.com.au/services.html",
  "mainEntity": [
    {
      "@type": "Service",
      "serviceType": "Rental Property Inspection",
      "provider": {
        "@type": "LocalBusiness",
        "name": "Trusted Inspection Diary"
      },
      "areaServed": {
        "@type": "Place",
        "name": "Hobart, Tasmania"
      },
      "description": "We attend rental property inspections on behalf of clients to provide independent reports."
    },
    {
      "@type": "Service",
      "serviceType": "Student Housing Check",
      "provider": {
        "@type": "LocalBusiness",
        "name": "Trusted Inspection Diary"
      },
      "areaServed": {
        "@type": "Place",
        "name": "Tasmania, Australia"
      },
      "description": "We verify student accommodation options to ensure accurate information and safe housing."
    },
    {
      "@type": "Service",
      "serviceType": "Relocation Support",
      "provider": {
        "@type": "LocalBusiness",
        "name": "Trusted Inspection Diary"
      },
      "areaServed": {
        "@type": "Place",
        "name": "Tasmania, Australia"
      },
      "description": "We assist clients with settling into new homes and communities in Tasmania."
    },
    {
      "@type": "Service",
      "serviceType": "Landlord Routine Inspection",
      "provider": {
        "@type": "LocalBusiness",
        "name": "Trusted Inspection Diary"
      },
      "areaServed": {
        "@type": "Place",
        "name": "Tasmania, Australia"
      },
      "description": "We conduct routine property inspections for landlords to ensure properties are well maintained."
    }
  ]
}
</script>
```

## ✅ Why This Helps
- Each **Service** is clearly defined → Google can highlight them individually in search results.  
- Improves **SEO visibility** for specific offerings (e.g., “student housing inspections Tasmania”).  
- Keeps everything bundled under one **WebPage** entity for clarity.  

---

## ⚡ Pro Tip
- Tailor descriptions to be concise and keyword‑rich.  
- Add **priceRange** or **offers** if you want Google to show pricing.  
- Validate with **Google’s Rich Results Test** after adding.

👉 Would you like me to also prepare an **Offers schema extension** (so each service can show pricing or booking info in search results)?
