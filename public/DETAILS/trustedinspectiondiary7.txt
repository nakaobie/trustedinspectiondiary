Excellent! Let’s walk through how to **combine multiple schema types (LocalBusiness + FAQPage + others)** on the same page without conflicts. This way, Google can understand your site holistically and show rich snippets for business info *and* FAQs.

## 🏗️ How to Combine Schema Types
- You can include **multiple `<script type="application/ld+json">` blocks** in the `<head>` of a page.  
- Each block describes a different aspect (business, FAQs, services, breadcrumbs, etc.).  
- Search engines parse them independently, so they don’t conflict.

## 📌 Example: Contact Page with LocalBusiness + FAQPage

```html
<!-- LocalBusiness schema -->
<script type="application/ld+json">
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "LocalBusiness",
  "name": "Trusted Inspection Diary",
  "url": "https://trustedinspectiondiary.com.au/contact.html",
  "telephone": "+61-400-123-456",
  "email": "info@trustedinspectiondiary.com.au",
  "address": {
    "@type": "PostalAddress",
    "streetAddress": "123 Example Street",
    "addressLocality": "Hobart",
    "addressRegion": "TAS",
    "postalCode": "7000",
    "addressCountry": "AU"
  },
  "openingHours": "Mo-Fr 09:00-17:00",
  "priceRange": "$$"
}
</script>

<!-- FAQPage schema -->
<script type="application/ld+json">
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "FAQPage",
  "mainEntity": [
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "Do you attend rental inspections on my behalf?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Yes, we attend open homes and private inspections for clients in Hobart."
      }
    },
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "Can you help with student housing?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "We provide independent checks to ensure students get accurate information about housing options."
      }
    }
  ]
}
</script>
```

## ✅ Best Practices
- Keep each schema block **separate** (don’t merge them into one JSON object).  
- Tailor schema types to the page’s purpose:
  - **Home page** → `WebSite` + `LocalBusiness`  
  - **About page** → `AboutPage` + `Organization`  
  - **Services page** → `Service`  
  - **Contact page** → `LocalBusiness` + `FAQPage`  
- Always validate with **Google’s Rich Results Test**.

## ⚡ Why This Works
- Google sees your business info (LocalBusiness) → shows address, phone, hours.  
- Google sees FAQs (FAQPage) → shows expandable Q&A in search results.  
- Together, you maximize visibility and click‑through rates.

👉 Would you like me to also prepare a **BreadcrumbList schema** so Google shows a navigation path (Home > Services > Contact) in search results?
